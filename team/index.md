Alex is an MRC Career Development Fellow leading the Microbiome Function and Diversity group at the University of Cambridge. His team focuses on understanding the role that the uncultured microbiome plays in human health and disease. He obtained his PhD in Microbiology at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, studying the opportunistic pathogen group B Streptococcus. After his PhD, he relocated to Cambridge with an EBI-Sanger Postdoctoral Fellowship to expand his research to metagenomic studies of the human gut microbiome. Using computational genomic methods, his work contributed to the discovery of thousands of uncultivated bacterial species in the human gut microbiome, more than tripling the number of gut-associated species previously known.

Qi is a visiting postdoc in the Microbiome Function and Diversity group interested in the discovery of novel probiotics and antimicrobials in the human gut microbiome. She finished her PhD in 2016 at the University of Chinese Academy Sciences and was a postdoc until 2020 when she began her appointment as an Associate Professor at the Chongqing Medical University. Her current research interests centre around the study of host-microbe interactions in the lung/gut microbiome, the molecular mechanisms of bacterial infection and development of novel antimicrobial agents.

Ana is a microbiologist who has transitioned from wet to dry-lab science. In her work, she uses the lens of bioinformatics to look at biological questions from the perspective and context of the data. She has worked at the interface of basic and translational research, having explored different branches of the Tree of Life: Drosophila (undergrad and MSc in Cell and Molecular Biology â€“ Portugal, exploring molecular basis of cold resistance), Microbes (post-doc & PhD at Nottingham, using phenotypic and genomic approaches to investigate ecology and evolution of polymicrobial chronic wounds) and Plants (MSc in Bioinformatics & post-doc at Nottingham, finding genomic factors underlying salinity tolerance). Currently Ana is using bioinformatics approaches to investigate the role of uncultured bacteria in the human gut, with the goal of understanding how the composition of the gut microbiome may influence the incidence of gut-related human diseases.
